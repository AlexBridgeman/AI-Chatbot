# About my AI Chatbot project powered by Google's Gemini API
You will need a application that connects to the MySQL database such as XAMPP or WampServer. Place the folder within the 'htdocs' folder if using XAMPP or 'www' folder if using Wampserver. Open 'localhost/AIChatbot'and click the 'public_html/' folder and the project should run. Register unique credentials and login to the system and you will be greeted by the AI chatbot.
